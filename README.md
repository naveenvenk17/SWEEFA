# SWEEFA

- This SWEEFA application will be developed in Python Julia. 
- SWEEFA stands for Solar & Wind Energy Estimation and Forecasting Application.
- It will consist of:
  - Solar Energy Estimation Application
  - Wind Energy Estimation Application
  - Forecasting Application:
    - ANN Forecasting Application
    - ARIMA Forecasting Application
    - WRF Forecasting Application
    - Data Pre-Post Processing Application
- [YouTube Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrlB-ixA7o7IL84ifYV5PYK9qQ8AgN6r4): for the SWEEFA application in MATLAB.
- The GUI will be developed in PyQT5
- ANN models will be developed using KERAS+TensoFlow
- ARIMA models will be developed using Statsmodel
- WRF will be used from NCAR and NCEP - available for free
- The goal of this project is to deveop a complete solution for Renewable Energy Forecasting at Power Plant level.
